## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass CSS pre processor
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

I used this challenge to reinforce my learning in front-end with Flexbox, in addition to revisiting Sass and Media Query concepts and reinforcing the BEM methodology concepts.

### Useful resources

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - This helped me for many reasons. I really learn more reading the documentation of this pre processor.
- [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout) - This is an amazing documentation which helped me finally understand flexbox layout. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
